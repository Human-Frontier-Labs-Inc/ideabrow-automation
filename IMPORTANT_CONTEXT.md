# CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR IDEABROW-PIPELINE

## Session Spawning Issue - SOLVED ✅

### The Problem We Fixed
The tmux orchestrator was creating NEW sessions when spawning agent teams, leading to session proliferation. Every time an agent tried to coordinate work, it would spawn completely new tmux sessions instead of working within the existing project session.

### The Solution Implemented
We've created a **session-constrained version** that works WITHIN existing sessions instead of creating new ones.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Session-Aware Scripts
- Modified `send-claude-message.sh` to auto-detect current session and work within it
- Modified `schedule_with_note.sh` to use the current session context
- Teams are now created as panes/windows in the CURRENT session only

### 2. No More Session Spawning
- Replaced `tmux new-session` with `tmux split-window` 
- All agent teams stay within your current project session
- Respects per-project tmux workflow

### 3. Global Agent Access
- Created `sync-claude-globally.sh` to make all 130 agents available in every project
- Agents can be accessed from any session without spawning new ones

### 4. Easy Activation
Any project can now run `./activate-orchestrator.sh` to start orchestration within their session

## How It Works Now

When you run the orchestrator:
1. It detects your CURRENT tmux session
2. Uses `tmux split-window` instead of `tmux new-session`
3. Keeps all agents/teams within your current project session
4. No new sessions are created - everything stays contained

## Usage Instructions

To use orchestration in any project:
1. Run: `/sync-global-agents sync` (makes all agents available globally)
2. In your project: `./activate-orchestrator.sh`
3. Teams spawn as panes in YOUR session, not new sessions

## Important Files

- `/home/wv3/.claude/orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh` - Session-aware message sender
- `/home/wv3/.claude/orchestrator/schedule_with_note.sh` - Session-aware scheduler
- `/home/wv3/.claude/orchestrator/sync-claude-globally.sh` - Global agent synchronizer
- `/home/wv3/.claude/orchestrator/activate-orchestrator.sh` - Project orchestrator activator

## Verification

To confirm no new sessions will be spawned:
1. Check the scripts above - they all use `split-window` not `new-session`
2. The orchestrator now respects session boundaries
3. Agent teams are panes/windows, not sessions

This completely solves the session proliferation problem while maintaining all autonomous capabilities!

## Pipeline Status

The ideabrow-pipeline is now production-ready with:
- ✅ Deduplication working (no duplicate repos)
- ✅ Session-constrained orchestration (no session spawning)
- ✅ Real repo cloning
- ✅ Phase scheduling with persistence
- ✅ 5-minute cooldown protection
- ✅ Full tmux integration WITHOUT creating new sessions
