# Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview
TicketHawk is crafted to deliver instant alerts on last-minute ticket deals, targeting superfans and budget-conscious event-goers. The product is designed to capture unsold inventory quickly and help users secure tickets at reduced prices by leveraging real-time API integrations.

TicketHawk will address two main markets: the consumer segment (individual users) and the B2B segment (venues and event organizers). This dual-edged approach allows the platform to monetize both through subscriptions and analytics dashboards provided to partners.

## Core Features
The following features are central to the TicketHawk product:
- Real-time Ticket Monitoring: Detect inventory changes faster than competitors with advanced algorithms.
- Customizable Alerts: Users can set price thresholds and receive instant SMS or app notifications.
- Historical Pricing Analytics: Optional premium module providing trends and historical pricing data.
- Venue Analytics Dashboard: A B2B feature that offers insights and inventory movement analysis for partner venues.
- Integration with Ticketing Platforms: Direct API connectivity with top platforms to fetch real-time data.

Each feature is designed to enhance usability and ensure the speed and reliability necessary for last-minute ticket purchases.

## User Stories
- As a concert enthusiast, I want to receive an alert when my favorite artist’s tickets drop below my target price so that I can purchase them at a discount.
- As a budget-conscious ticket buyer, I desire a system that automatically tracks ticket availability, enabling me to secure a good deal without continuously monitoring the event details.
- As an event venue manager, I require a dashboard that provides analytics on unsold inventory, helping optimize dynamic pricing strategies and minimize revenue loss.

These user stories help define the product requirements and ensure that all developments directly address the target audience’s needs.
