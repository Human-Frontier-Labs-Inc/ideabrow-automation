# DoomScroll Destroyer - Requirements Document

## Overview
DoomScroll Destroyer is a web application that literally fights back against your doomscrolling addiction by progressively making your experience more unbearable until you finally close the damn app and go touch grass. It's like a digital intervention from your future self who's tired of watching you waste your life.

## Problem Statement
Everyone's addicted to scrolling through an endless feed of existential dread. The world's on fire, democracy is having a midlife crisis, and we're all just sitting here refreshing our feeds like digital slot machine addicts. Time to break the cycle with aggressive UX patterns that make scrolling physically uncomfortable.

## Core Features

### 1. Progressive Annoyance Engine
- Starts subtle: slight lag after 5 minutes of scrolling
- Gets worse: random page jumps, content flickering
- Peak chaos: upside-down text, Comic Sans takeover
- Final boss: screen literally tells you to "GO OUTSIDE YOU GOBLIN"
- Emergency exit button that requires solving a CAPTCHA about grass texture

### 2. Doom Metrics Dashboard
- "Time Wasted Today: 4 hours 37 minutes (that's 1/6 of your remaining life)"
- "Anxiety Level: DEFCON 2 (approaching meltdown)"
- "Serotonin Remaining: 3% (recharge by closing app)"
- "Friends Who Miss You: Probably some"
- Real-time counter of missed opportunities while scrolling

### 3. Intervention Mode
- After 30 minutes: Philosophical quotes about mortality
- After 1 hour: Photos of puppies with disappointed expressions
- After 2 hours: Your LinkedIn profile with "Is this who you wanted to be?"
- After 3 hours: Automatic donation to charity with your scrolling time
- After 4 hours: App locks and plays meditation sounds aggressively

### 4. Reality Check Notifications
- "Your plant is dying"
- "When did you last shower?"
- "Your posture looks like a question mark"
- "That thing you're worried about won't matter in 5 years"
- "The algorithm doesn't love you back"

### 5. Scroll Shaming Social Features
- Public leaderboard of biggest time wasters (opt-in masochism)
- "Intervention requests" from friends who can remotely lock your app
- Automated "I'm touching grass" posts when you finally go outside
- Achievement system but for NOT using the app
- "Streak breaker" - celebrates when you break your doom-scrolling streak

## User Experience Requirements

### Aggressive Anti-Patterns
- Loading spinners that judge you: "Still here, huh?"
- Pull-to-refresh becomes increasingly difficult (like, physically)
- Infinite scroll becomes finite with a hard stop: "That's enough, champ"
- Dark mode automatically brightens to hurt your vampire eyes
- Haptic feedback that feels increasingly like disappointment

### Motivational Insults
- "Your screen time would make a casino owner blush"
- "Remember when you had hobbies?"
- "This app is free because YOU are the product, dummy"
- "Breaking: Local person discovers life exists outside phone"
- "Your thumbs have scrolled the distance to the moon"

### Exit Strategies
- "Quick escape" button for work emergencies (limited to 3/day)
- "I touched grass" photo proof requirement to unlock extra time
- Progressive unlock: solve increasingly complex math to continue
- Voice activation required: "I am wasting my finite existence"
- Physical exercise mini-game to earn more scroll time

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- React (because we're basic like that)
- Seizure-inducing CSS animations after prolonged use
- Canvas API for making text literally run away from chronic scrollers
- WebGL for 3D guilt trips
- Service worker that reminds you the app exists when you try to be productive

### Backend
- Node.js server that's disappointed in your choices
- PostgreSQL database of shame statistics
- Redis cache for "time since last grass touch"
- WebSocket connections for real-time intervention broadcasts
- Cron jobs that text your mom about your screen time

### Integrations
- Weather API: "It's beautiful outside, unlike your life choices"
- Calendar API: "You have 6 overdue tasks but sure, keep scrolling"
- Fitness tracker: "Your step count is embarrassing"
- Screen time APIs: "You've spent 73% of your waking hours here"
- Local news: "Things happening in your actual community"

## Success Metrics
- Average session time: Decreasing (that's the point)
- "Grass touched" events per user
- Intervention success rate
- Uninstall rate (high = working as intended)
- User testimonials like "I hate this app, 5 stars"

## MVP Scope
1. Basic progressive annoyance system
2. Time tracking with aggressive shaming
3. One intervention mode (disappointed puppies)
4. Exit challenges requiring actual thought
5. Public commitment system

## Monetization Strategy
- Free to use, expensive to keep using
- "Pro" version that's actually worse (more aggressive)
- Donate your scroll time to charity
- Sponsors: Local parks, hiking trails, therapists
- NFTs of your worst scroll sessions (just kidding... unless?)

## Marketing Tagline
"The only app that hates you more than you hate yourself while doomscrolling"

## Future Features
- AR mode that shows you what you're missing IRL
- Integration with smart home to literally turn lights off
- Parental controls but for adults
- Group interventions via video chat
- AI therapist that's tired of your excuses
