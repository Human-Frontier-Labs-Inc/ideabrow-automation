# Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

## Overview
SocialDecoder is an AI-powered social navigation tool designed to assist neurodivergent professionals in decoding unwritten workplace social norms. The system performs real-time analysis of communications, offering context-sensitive support during emails, meetings, and other digital interactions. It aims to reduce the “social tax” faced by its users and enhance workplace inclusion.

SocialDecoder will incorporate natural language processing (NLP), contextual analysis, and machine learning algorithms to translate ambiguous social cues into clear, actionable guidance. The system must integrate seamlessly with common calendar and email applications to provide support at the point of need.

## Functional Requirements
- Real-time social context analysis: The system should analyze live communications during meetings and monitor email or messaging exchanges for social cues.
- Social navigation prompts: Offer instant, actionable feedback and suggestions relevant to specific workplace scenarios.
- Scenario script library: Provide a library of situation-based scripts that can help guide user responses.
- API integration: Expose endpoints for enterprise clients to integrate with HR platforms.
- Crowdsourced data enrichment: Allow contributions to continuously update and refine the knowledge base on social norms.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Must process and return feedback in near real-time (under 5 seconds delay) to maintain conversational flow.
- Scalability: The architecture should support growth from a few hundred to tens of thousands of concurrent users.
- Privacy: Strict on-device processing and privacy modes are required, with compliance to SOC 2 standards.
- User Experience: Ensure intuitive UI that minimizes disruption while maximizing clarity and usability, with 90% positive user satisfaction based on early tests.
- Reliability: Guarantee a 99.5% uptime to support critical communication moments.

## Architecture & Integration
- Modular design separating NLP processing, API endpoints, and user interface components.
- Integration with common digital collaboration platforms such as Google Calendar, Outlook, and email clients.
- Use of a microservices architecture to allow independent scaling of real-time analysis and data storage components.
- Data flows should safeguard sensitive user data through on-device processing when possible and secure server-side handling otherwise.
