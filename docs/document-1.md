# Technical Requirements Document

## System Overview
TicketHawk is engineered as a real-time ticket monitoring platform that must deliver alerts for last-minute concert and event ticket sales. The system will interface directly with multiple ticketing platform APIs and venue backends to detect inventory changes and price drops with minimal latency. This document outlines the system architecture, required integrations, performance benchmarks, and security standards.

## System Architecture
The platform comprises several key modules:
- Data Collection Module: Aggregates real-time data from over 20 ticketing platforms and direct venue APIs.
- Notification Engine: Processes inventory and price changes to trigger SMS and app alerts.
- User Interface: A dashboard for users to set price thresholds and view historical pricing data.
- Analytics & Reporting: Provides venues with insights on unsold inventory and ticket price dynamics.

This microservices-based design ensures the system remains scalable and fault-tolerant. Each component is containerized and deployed in a multi-region cloud environment to guarantee high availability during peak demand.

## API Integration Requirements
TicketHawk must support direct integrations with venue APIs as well as public ticketing platforms. It is critical to achieve a monitoring interval that is 4-6 minutes faster than competitors. The API endpoints will be designed with REST principles and must include robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.

### API Endpoints Overview
| Endpoint            | Method | Description                                                        |
|---------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /api/v1/tickets     | GET    | Retrieves current ticket listings and pricing data from sources    |
| /api/v1/alerts      | POST   | Manages alert subscriptions and sends real-time SMS notifications    |
| /api/v1/venues     | GET    | Fetches venue-specific data, including direct API integration feeds  |

- All endpoints will enforce secure authentication and use encrypted channels for data transmission.
- Detailed error logging and tracking need to be incorporated to quickly diagnose and mitigate issues.
- Scalability for high-frequency data polling is a top priority, especially during critical event windows.

## Performance and Scalability
The system must support high request volumes during events with robust load balancing and auto-scaling mechanisms. Key performance benchmarks include:
- Alert delivery within seconds of inventory detection.
- A real-time monitoring update cycle that detects price changes with minimal delay.
- The system architecture should be capable of handling thousands of concurrent users and alert triggers.

Furthermore, the chosen database and cache systems must support rapid writes and reads, ensuring that historical and real-time data remain consistent across the platform.

## Security and Compliance
Security measures are essential given the real-time nature of the service and the sensitive integration with multiple third-party APIs.
- Data encryption in transit and at rest is mandatory.
- Access to every API is limited by role-based permissions and strict authentication protocols.
- Regular security audits and compliance checks must be scheduled to ensure no unauthorized access to ticketing data.

Additional measures include operating within the constraints of public API usage and adhering to ticketing platformsâ€™ policies. Detailed legal compliance protocols must be established for handling any data access disputes with venues.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation
- Develop fallback strategies in case primary APIs become inaccessible.
- Monitor system latency closely to ensure competitive speed advantages remain intact.
- Implement multi-region redundancy to mitigate the risk of localized system failures.
