# Technical Requirements Document

## Overview
ProteinPilot is an AI-powered nutrition app that simplifies protein tracking using image recognition, adaptive meal planning, and grocery integrations. This document outlines the technical requirements necessary to support the core functionalities of the platform, ensuring scalability, data security, and seamless user experience.

## Functional Requirements

### Image Recognition and Protein Calculation
- The system must integrate with an image recognition API (e.g., Google Vision API) to interpret food images and automatically estimate protein content.
- Ensure real-time processing with minimal latency to allow instant feedback on protein amounts.
- Provide fallback handling for ambiguous images by prompting further user input.

### Meal Planning and Adaptive Suggestions
- Develop a dynamic meal planning module that adapts to user habits, dietary restrictions, and protein requirements.
- Implement a recommendation engine powered by machine learning to personalize meal plans.
- Allow user feedback loops to refine plan accuracy over time.

### Grocery Integration and Ordering
- Integrate with grocery delivery services via standardized APIs.
- Support real-time inventory and ingredient availability checks.
- Ensure secure, one-click ordering functionality that simplifies purchasing missing ingredients.

## Non-functional Requirements

### Performance and Scalability
- The system must handle increasing query loads as the user base grows, targeting seamless expansion from 5,000 initial users up to 20,000 and beyond.
- Use cloud-native services to ensure reliable uptime and auto-scaling capabilities.

### Security and Compliance
- Ensure full GDPR/HIPAA compliance and encrypted storage of sensitive user data.
- Implement robust authentication and authorization measures to protect user privacy.
- Regularly update AI models with anonymized user data while maintaining security standards.

### Integration Points

| API Endpoint         | Functionality                        | Technology / Provider   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| /upload-image        | Image recognition for protein count  | Google Vision API       |
| /meal-plan           | Retrieve personalized meal suggestions| Custom ML model         |
| /grocery-order       | Process ingredient orders            | Partnered Grocery API   |

## System Architecture
- The backend will be developed using a microservices architecture to isolate image processing, user management, and grocery integration.
- Data flows include external API calls for image analysis, recommendation engine interactions, secure payment integration, and user feedback ingestion.
