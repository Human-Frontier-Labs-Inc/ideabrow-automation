# Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

## Overview
SafeViewShield is designed to safeguard children from AI-generated content by leveraging advanced computer vision and audio analysis. The system detects subtle manipulations in synthetic media, providing real-time filtering and continuous improvement via a feedback loop. The product supports two primary user segments: individual families through a browser extension and educational institutions via API integration.

## Functional Requirements
- Real-time content analysis for visual, audio, and behavioral data.
- Browser extension functionality to block or flag content instantly.
- API endpoints to allow school and enterprise integration, including white-label options.
- User feedback mechanism that refines and updates detection algorithms.
- Modular integration for seamless scalability across thousands of users.
  
## Non-functional Requirements
- High system availability and scalability to manage fluctuating demand.
- Robust security protocols in line with COPPA, GDPR, and FERPA to ensure data privacy.
- Performance metrics to support real-time analysis with a target latency under 500ms.
- Seamless user experience with minimal system downtime.
- Regular AI model updates driven by a dedicated R&D team ensuring adaptability to new threats.

## Technical Architecture
SafeViewShield employs a distributed architecture hosted on major cloud providers (AWS/GCP) to ensure high availability and scalability. The system is divided into the following major components:
- Data ingestion layer for content analysis using computer vision and audio analytics.
- Processing engine which incorporates machine learning models that update via user feedback.
- API gateway that manages requests from schools and educational platforms.
- Frontend layer for the browser extension with a streamlined user interface.
