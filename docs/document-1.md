# Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

## Overview
FamilyEscape is a premium family travel platform designed to bring exclusive, discounted luxury travel options paired with authentic cultural and educational experiences. This document outlines the technical foundations, architectural design, integration points, and system requirements that will support the platform’s core functionalities, including itinerary building, resort inventory management, and transactional services such as booking and payment processing.

FamilyEscape’s technical vision emphasizes reliability, scalability, and security. The system must accommodate a growing user base of affluent families while handling peak loads during travel booking seasons. The objective is to reduce planning time significantly and deliver a seamless, engaging user experience through a robust technical infrastructure.

## System Architecture
### Architectural Overview
- The platform will be built on a microservices architecture to allow independent scaling of core components such as user management, booking services, and content curation.
- A secure RESTful API layer will facilitate interactions between the front-end and the back-end, enabling integration with external services such as payment processors and resort partners.
- Cloud-based hosting and scalable databases will be adopted, using container orchestration for deployment, ensuring high availability and performance.

### Components
- Front-end Web and Mobile Interfaces: User dashboards, booking interfaces, and itinerary editors.
- Back-end Services: Payment processing, booking commission tracking, and partner inventory management.
- Integration Layer: API endpoints for partner resorts, cultural experience providers, and affiliate marketing platforms.
