# Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

## Overview
SafeViewShield is an AI-driven platform designed to detect and block synthetic content that may pose risks to children in family and school environments. The solution leverages advanced algorithms to analyze visual cues, audio anomalies, and behavioral patterns that are typically missed by traditional content filtering tools. This document outlines the technical requirements for building a scalable, multi-platform protective system.

## System Architecture
### AI Detection Engine
- The engine must support analysis of multi-modal inputs including video, audio, and behavioral metrics.
- It should continuously learn from user feedback and incorporate real-time improvements.
- <Add detailed API authentication flow here>

### Browser Extension and API Integration
- Develop a browser-based extension compatible with platforms such as YouTube Kids, TikTok, and similar digital environments.
- Ensure that an API is available for educational platforms to integrate detection capabilities into Learning Management Systems (LMS).
- The system must meet high availability, with a target uptime of 99.9%, and provide seamless integration points.

### Data Security & Compliance
- The platform must adhere to COPPA and GDPR regulations with built-in data encryption and anonymization protocols.
- Regular audits and compliance checks should be scheduled to mitigate risks associated with sensitive user data.
- Implement role-based access controls for system administrators and stakeholders.

## Performance and Scalability
### Response Time and Throughput
- Detection algorithms should return results within 2-3 seconds for real-time content filtering.
- The system must be capable of processing high-volume requests for both family and educational usage scenarios.
- Maintain detailed logs and performance metrics to enable proactive scaling.

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Utilize cloud computing resources to ensure scalability across various regions including North America, EU, and APAC.
- The architecture should support horizontal scaling and load balancing to accommodate growing user bases.
- Table: Infrastructure Components and Specifications

| Component            | Specification/Requirement                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Cloud Provider       | AWS/Azure/Google Cloud with high SLA        |
| Load Balancer        | Support for auto-scaling and session persistence |
| Database             | Encrypted, scalable NoSQL or SQL solution (min. 3 distributed nodes) |

## Integration & Communication
### API Endpoints and Protocols
- Standardize communication using RESTful API practices with JSON-based responses.
- Each endpoint shall include error handling, rate limiting, and version control.
- Placeholder for further detailed API documentation exists if needed.

### User Feedback Integration
- Incorporate a feedback loop mechanism to enable users (parents/educators) to report anomalies and help improve detection algorithms.
- Feedback data should be stored securely and used for periodic model retraining.
