# CloudSync - Multi-Cloud Storage Manager

## Executive Summary
Build a unified cloud storage management platform that allows users to manage files across multiple cloud providers (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, AWS S3) from a single interface. The platform will provide seamless file synchronization, intelligent deduplication, and advanced search capabilities across all connected storage services.

## Problem Statement
Users and businesses often have files scattered across multiple cloud storage providers, making it difficult to:
- Find specific files across different platforms
- Manage storage quotas efficiently
- Avoid duplicate files wasting space
- Maintain consistent folder structures
- Share files cross-platform
- Backup important data reliably

CloudSync solves these problems by providing a centralized management hub with intelligent automation.
