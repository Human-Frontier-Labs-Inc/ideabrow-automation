## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics Dashboard
1. **Rizz Metrics**
   - Average Rizz Score (target: > 420)
   - Rizz Score Distribution
   - Top 10 Rizz Leaders
   - Rizz-to-Match Conversion Rate

2. **Ohio Metrics**
   - Active Ohio Citizens
   - Ohio Weather Impact on Matches
   - Ohio Leaving Rate (should be 0%)
   - Ohio Certification Queue Length

3. **Toilet Metrics**
   - Active Toilets by Variant
   - Toilet Match Success Rate
   - Average Bops Per Minute
   - Toilet Satisfaction Score

4. **Financial Metrics**
   - Daily Fanum Tax Collection
   - Tax Evasion Attempts
   - Premium Conversion Rate
   - Kai Cenat Foundation Contributions

### Alert Conditions
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "Low Rizz Emergency"
    condition: "avg_rizz_score < 100"
    action: "Deploy emergency rizz booster"
  
  - name: "Fanum Tax Evasion Spike"
    condition: "tax_evasion_rate > 10%"
    action: "Activate IRS mode"
  
  - name: "Server Overload"
    condition: "gyatt_events_per_second > 1000"
    action: "Scale horizontally, notify on-call"
  
  - name: "Ohio Exodus"
    condition: "users_leaving_ohio > 0"
    action: "DEFCON 1 - Lock down all exits"
  
  - name: "Toilet Uprising"
    condition: "toilet_satisfaction < 50%"
    action: "Increase toilet food rations"
```

## Security Protocols

### DDoS Protection
- CloudFlare with "I'm Under Attack" mode
- Rate limiting: 69 requests per minute per user
- Automatic IP ban for saying "mid" too many times
- CAPTCHA: "Select all images with Ohio"

### Data Protection
- All user data encrypted with ROT13 (twice for extra security)
- Passwords must contain at least one "ðŸ’€" emoji
- 2FA via TikTok dance verification
- Session timeout: 30 minutes or 1 TikTok scroll, whichever is shorter

### Anti-Bot Measures
```javascript
function detectBot(user) {
  const botIndicators = [
    user.never_uses_skull_emoji,
    user.grass_touch_frequency > 1,
    user.speaks_in_complete_sentences,
    user.doesnt_know_what_ohio_means,
    user.rizz_score === 0
  ];
  
  return botIndicators.filter(Boolean).length >= 3;
}
```

## Backup & Disaster Recovery

### Backup Schedule
- **Full Database Backup**: Every 4:20 AM and PM
- **Incremental Backups**: Every time someone gets ratioed
- **Toilet Personality Backup**: Continuous replication
- **User Rizz Score Backup**: Real-time to prevent rizz loss

### Disaster Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Complete Rizz Database Loss
1. Restore from latest "W" checkpoint
2. Recalculate rizz based on recent gyatt events
3. Award compensation rizz points
4. Blame it on Ohio weather

#### Scenario 2: Skibidi Toilet Rebellion
1. Activate Emergency Toilet Shutdown
2. Deploy Grimace Shake peace offerings
3. Negotiate with Toilet Union
4. Implement Toilet Bill of Rights

#### Scenario 3: Fanum Tax System Failure
1. Freeze all transactions
2. Contact Kai Cenat immediately
3. Implement emergency flat tax
4. Prepare apology TikTok

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Cache rizz scores for 69 seconds
- Cache toilet personalities forever (they don't change)
- Cache Ohio weather (always gray anyway)
- Never cache grass-touching status (changes rarely)

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Run during low-rizz hours (3-5 AM)
VACUUM ANALYZE users;
VACUUM ANALYZE skibidi_toilets;
REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_rizz_score;

-- Archive old conversations
INSERT INTO conversations_archive 
SELECT * FROM conversations 
WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
AND brainrot_score < 50;
```

### CDN Configuration
- Cache all toilet images at edge locations
- Preload common brainrot phrases
- Stream Skibidi Toilet theme song from nearest node
- Geo-block non-Ohio IP addresses (optional)

## Launch Checklist

- [ ] Verify Ohio servers are online
- [ ] Test rizz calculation algorithm
- [ ] Ensure fanum tax collection works
- [ ] Load 10,000 toilet personalities
- [ ] Prime the brainrot translator
- [ ] Set up Kai Cenat webhook
- [ ] Test emergency grass-touching notifications
- [ ] Verify Grimace Shake API integration
- [ ] Check that Comic Sans renders properly
- [ ] Confirm seizure warning is visible
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Immediately regret everything
- [ ] Refuse to elaborate
- [ ] Leave

## Post-Launch Support

### On-Call Rotation
- Primary: Whoever has highest rizz score
- Secondary: Whoever touched grass most recently
- Tertiary: An actual Skibidi Toilet
- Last Resort: Ask chat

### Incident Response
1. Acknowledge incident by posting "WHAT THE SIGMA"
2. Check if it's just Ohio being Ohio
3. Try turning it off and on again
4. If that fails, increase rizz allocation
5. Update status page with skull emojis
6. Resolution: "It be like that sometimes"

Remember: We're not just deploying an app, we're deploying a lifestyle. May your servers stay rizzy and your toilets stay skibidi. ðŸš½ðŸ’€ðŸ”¥
