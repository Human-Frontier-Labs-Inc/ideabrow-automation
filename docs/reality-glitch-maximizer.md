# REALITY GLITCH MAXIMIZER 🌀💥🔮

## The App That Shouldn't Exist But Does

### WARNING: This app may cause existential crises, spontaneous enlightenment, or uncontrollable laughter at the fabric of reality

## What The F*ck Is This?

Reality Glitch Maximizer is a web app that actively seeks out and amplifies the glitches in your personal simulation. Using advanced quantum entanglement algorithms (we made this up), blockchain-powered chaos magic (also made up), and AI-driven reality distortion fields (you guessed it), this app will make you question whether you're the player or the NPC.

## Technical Implementation (lol)

```javascript
class RealityGlitchMaximizer {
  constructor() {
    this.reality = undefined;
    this.consensus = Math.random() > 0.5;
    this.schrodinger = null || !null;
    this.timeLoop = setInterval(() => {
      clearInterval(this.timeLoop);
      this.timeLoop = setInterval(...arguments);
    }, Math.random() * 10000);
  }

  async glitchReality() {
    while (true && !true) {
      await this.quantumFluctuate();
      if (Math.random() > Math.random()) {
        throw new Error("Error is a social construct");
      }
    }
  }

  observeUser() {
    // By observing the user, we change their state
    return !this.observeUser();
  }
}
```
